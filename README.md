# Crew Ops Advisor — Synthetic Dataset

Master dataset for the dCortex hackathon problem statement. Deterministic
(seed 42), regenerable with `generate.py`, independently checked by `validate.py`.

**Carrier:** dCortex Air (fictional) · **Hub:** BLR · **Week:** 2026-09-14 → 2026-09-20
**Snapshot ("now"):** `2026-09-14T18:00:00Z` · **All times UTC** · **Currency: INR**

## Contents

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `data/flights.json` | 147 legs, 8 stations, 6 aircraft (4× A320-162, 2× ATR72-72), rotations + block hours |
| `data/crew.json` | 150 crew — rank, base, ratings, seniority, reachability, status (`active`/`leave`/`training`) |
| `data/rosters.json` | 39 pairings with per-day flights, report/release, full crew complements; `flagged_exceptions` lists the one deliberately illegal assignment |
| `data/duty_clocks.json` | Per crew: 28 days of daily duty/flight hours (2026-08-18 → 09-14), 7d/28d summaries, `last_rest_ended` |
| `data/reserve_pool.json` | 16 reserves with on-call windows. A reserve is usable when the **required report time** falls inside their window |
| `data/certifications.json` | 4 cert types per crew with validity dates |
| `data/rules.json` | The 7 rules, machine-readable params + prose. **Windows are calendar-day based** (see below) |
| `data/costs.json` | Callout / deadhead / delay / cancellation rates |
| `data/risk_signals.json` | Pre-computed disruption-risk scores (provided input — teams do NOT build prediction) |
| `data/scenarios.json` | 6 worked scenarios (S1–S6) with **computed** answer keys |
| `data/questions.json` | 38 questions (16 Tier-1, 14 Tier-2, 8 Tier-3) with expected answers |
| `internal/held_out_scenarios.json` | 2 held-out scenarios for judging. **Do not ship to participants** |
| `validate.py` | Independent consistency checker (no shared code with the generator) |
| `generate.py` | Regenerates everything. Internal — reveals answer-key derivations |

## Conventions teams must know (also stated in rules.json)

- **Duty period** = report → release. Report = first departure −60 min; release = last arrival +30 min.
- **RULE-FDP-01**: max FDP = 13h − 0.5h per sector beyond the 2nd.
- **RULE-DUTY-02 / RULE-FLT-03**: rolling windows are **calendar-day** windows (7 / 28 UTC dates, inclusive of the duty date). `daily_history` in duty_clocks.json exists precisely so these are computable on any day of the week.
- **RULE-REST-04**: ≥12h between release and next report.
- **Reserve windows**: the required report time (after any deadhead positioning) must fall inside the on-call window; once activated, the reserve operates as line crew.
- **Deadhead (RULE-BASE-07)**: positioning DEL→BLR uses DX402 (arr 08:45Z; odd dates) or DX589 (arr 07:45Z; even dates); new report = arrival +15 min; costs = callout + positioning + delay hours × `delay_cost_per_duty_hour`.

## Scenario independence

Each scenario is an **alternate timeline applied to the base snapshot**. They do
not chain: S2's sick call does not exist in S6's world. Answer keys are
computed by exhaustive candidate enumeration against the rules; equal-cost
plans (e.g. S6 mirror assignments) are equally correct.

## Engineered facts (these reproduce the problem-statement examples exactly)

- `C-1042` (A. Nair, Captain, BLR) operates 2-day pairing `P-2291`: day 1 `DX412/DX413/DX588`, day 2 `DX589/DX590/DX591`.
- Covering P-2291 with `C-2087` breaches RULE-DUTY-02 by **1h20m** (61.33h vs 60h).
- Reserve `C-3310` covers it cleanly at **₹18,500**.
- `C-2210` (DEL) is legal via deadhead at **₹41,200** (18,500 + 6,500 + 3h × 5,400), delaying DX412 ~3h.
- `C-3305` (early-window reserve) is a teaching case: legal for day 1 in isolation, breaches DUTY-02 on day 2.
- `C-2091` is ATR-only — the RULE-QUAL-05 exclusion case.
- The single flagged roster exception: one cabin crew's `recurrent_training` expires 2026-09-17 while rostered 2026-09-19 (scenario S5).

## ⚠ One fix needed in the problem-statement doc before release

The Tier-2 example question says "**FO** C-2087" — in the dataset (and in the
doc's own worked output, where C-2087 substitutes for a *captain*), **C-2087 is
a Captain**. Change "FO C-2087" → "Captain C-2087" in the doc.

## Verifying

```bash
python3 validate.py            # checks data/ (PASS/FAIL with details)
python3 generate.py            # regenerates everything (seed-stable)
```

## OpenAI + MCP advisor

The project includes a read-only MCP server with tools for crew, flights,
rosters, reserves, duty clocks, certifications, rules, costs, risk signals,
public scenarios, and evaluation questions. `main.py` connects those tools to
the OpenAI Responses API. Private held-out scenarios are not exposed.

Requirements: Python 3.10+ and an OpenAI API key.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -e .
```

Configure the git-ignored `.env` file:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6-terra
CREW_OPS_VERBOSE=0
```

Run interactively or ask one question:

```bash
venv/bin/python main.py
venv/bin/python main.py "Which flights depart DEL on 2026-09-15?"
```

Show every MCP tool call, its input arguments, and its complete returned data:

```bash
venv/bin/python main.py --verbose "Can C-2210 legally cover P-2291?"
```

Verbose mode displays observable model steps and tool evidence, but not private
internal chain-of-thought. Override the configured model with `--model`.

## Web interface

Start the streaming Crew Ops web application:

```bash
venv/bin/python -m crew_ops.web_app
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000). The page streams every
real MCP tool call while the agent works. Each row shows the tool name, its input
purpose, completion state, and an expandable view of the returned evidence. The
final OpenAI response appears beneath the completed tool timeline.

The server reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL` from `.env`. Optional server
settings are `WEB_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`) and `WEB_PORT` (default `8000`).
